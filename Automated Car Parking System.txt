Features:

    Real-time Display:
        Display the current count of available parking spots, providing users with instant information.

    Semaphore System:
        Implement a semaphore system that signals whether cars are permitted to enter, ensuring organized and controlled access.

    Smart Illumination:
        Automatically illuminate the parking area during the night based on the readings from a light sensor. The system should intelligently turn off the lights during daylight hours.

    Spot Availability LEDs:
        Incorporate individual LEDs for each parking spot to visually indicate their availability, facilitating easy identification for drivers.

    Total Cars Display:
        Integrate a display that shows the total number of cars that have entered the parking area, enhancing management capabilities.

    Enhanced Safety Measures:
        Enhance safety with a smoke detector triggering a response:

            Activate all lights.
            Turn the lights red to alert users.
            Trigger an alarm sound to prompt an immediate evacuation of the parking facility.
